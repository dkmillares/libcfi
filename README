This is a Configuration File Interface library, CFI.

This library performs the task of reading (loading) and writing (storing)
general purpose configuration files.  The loaded data can be searched and
changed, or data can be created from scratch, and then stored into a file.

The format of the configuration files that CFI can read and write is defined by
the CFI grammar.  The CFI grammar is a small general dictionary grammar that
can be used to describe a wide variety of general purpose configuration
parameters.

CFI is the transport mechanism enforcing the CFI grammar; it moves data to and
fro, from correctly formatted configuration files to data structures in memory,
and from the data structures in memory to a configuration file.

CFI has an API which provides functions to read and write files, and to create
and change data in internal data structures.

The CFI dictionary grammar for configuration files:
