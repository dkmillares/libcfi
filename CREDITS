I have taken some code, without explicit permission, for use in CFI.  The
following people have not actively contributed to CFI; they are not known
by me to indorse CFI; they probably do not know that CFI exists.

     The CFI string handling functions are taken from libPropList; so someone
     else (Bjoern Giesler?) deserves credit for the string handling code.
